1. In Jest, what are the differences between describe() and it() globals, and what are good uses for them?

  'describe' is the overall source of action, i.e. server, get, insert, etc., whereas 'it' describes a particular outcomes branching from the source of action.

2. What is the point of Test Driven Development? What do you think about this approach?

 TDD breaks down the coding process into minute parts, and begins by writing a test prior to the actual code. I see mostly benefits to this style of development, though with small projects I could see it becoming a heavier load than the project itself. For larger projects, while the initial coding time will obviously increase, fixing issues in the future will clearly be faster.

3. Mention three types of automated tests.

  Unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.
